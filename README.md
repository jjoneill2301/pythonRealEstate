Real estate calculators for various uses. 

# Version 1
Takes in a comma delimited file and creates a list of data out of it to then be looped through and added to three different dictionaries.
Each key is city/zip/property type and each value is the corresponding price
Simply loop through each and println before providing calculations for:

Minimum:

Maximum:

Total:  

Average:

Median: 

# Version 2 w/ inputValidation
Uses a touple of [y, n] to either (y) continue the program and prompt the user for another entry or (n).
Once n is entered the program will stop querying for data and provide a commission based off a constant percentage and the total.
On top of this, it will perform the same calculations as Version 1.
